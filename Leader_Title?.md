## You Don't Need A Title To Be A Leader

* That fact is, all leadership begins with self-mastery. you can't lead others until you first lead yourself.
* The people who change the world around them, - for themselves, their companies, communities, and families-rarely act from a sense of obligation. In fact, the people who act as leaders almost always act with a sense of incredible opportunity. They don't interact with the world around them because they have to. They do so because they want to.
* People who take an active leadership role in their lives tend to be good thinkers, great leaders tend to be great thinkers.
* Too often, people confuse activity with accomplishment. As we all know, it is easy to be incredibly busy and still accomplish little.
* Most people aren't too busy to look up from the grindstone- they are just afraid of what they might find when they do.
* I think of the self-mastery index, as the ratio between the promises kept- both to oneself and to others. If your mouth keeps making promises that you can't keep, there is a great deal of room for improvement. Integrity, after all, is measured by the distance between your lips and your life.
* Everyone has good ideas. Our problem isn't lack of ideas, but a lack of recall. Ideas are fleeting, they misy be captured.
* Focus and determination beat brains and intellect everytime. You don't necessarily have to be smarter or better educated to succeed. Your power lies in your ability to focus on doing what is important. If you focus on the right things and work at them often, you will achieve exceptional results.
* Creating a daily of things to do is only a part of the solution. Knowing what is most important on that list, and choosing to complete it first, is the other part.
* The greatest good you can do for another is not just to share your riches, but to reveal to him his own.
* People do things for their own reasons, not for yours. To be an effective leader, you need to know how to motivate others.
* One of the most effective means of engaging others is to simply tell them, 'I need your help'. Your very request invites participation instead of commanding it. You also make clear that the other person's opinion mater.
* What do you hope to be doing in 10 years?
* What values do you try to live your life by?
* To increase the odds of future success, why not feed forward. Provide people with the information they need to be successful before they undertake something.
* Execution is the chariot of genius- William Blake.
* You cannot build a reputation on what you are going to do- Henry Ford.
* I have coined a term to describe what people who act successfully as leaders do: I call it visioning. Vision is a noun, Visioning is a verb, describing one's ability to articulate and achieve a vision.
* To me the difference between vision and visioning is similar to the difference between creativity and innovation...Most people are pretty creative. In other words, you are creative. We all have the ability to come up with new ideas. Innovation on the other hand, is the ability to implement those ideas.
* Decide what you want to accomplish. Think through what you will need to achieve your most ambitious goal: the resources of time, expertise, and the support of others.
* Work on nothing less than epic scale. Ask yourself, if we can turn the dream into reality what will that look like? - Francis Ford
* One thing that Marine Corps teaches is that it's better to be doing something than doing nothing. If you stay where you are, you're in the position where your enemy wants you to be. If you start doing something, you are changing the rules of the game.
* Next time you find yourself facing an important decision and you are  not sure what to do, ask yourself a simple question: When you have successfully confronted the challenge, how will you feel? And if you decide not to take that challenge, how will you feel months and years later about not having made the leap?
* When you make the world better for others, you make the world better for yourself.
* Even those companies that are successful today realise(or should realise) that the distance from being a supernova to being extinct can be very short indeed.
* In my experience, the marks in life we leave- our legacies-are most often left not in stone and steel, in history and politics, or poetry and literature, but in the lives of other people.
* Each of our lives is a leadership lab. We don't need a title, or an organization, to lead. What we need is nothing more nor less than a burning desire to make a positive difference and an awareness of the opportunities to lead that present themselves -each day -at work, at home with our friends, and relatives within our community.
