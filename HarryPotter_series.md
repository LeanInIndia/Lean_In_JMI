* The happiest man on earth would be able to use the mirror of Erised like a normal mirror, that is, he would look into it and see himself exactly as he is.

* It does not do to dwell on dreams and forget to live.

* Books and cleverness! There are more important things- friendship and bravery.

* There is no good and evil, there is only power, and those too weak to seek it.

* After all, to the well-organised mind, death is but the next great adventure.

* As much money and life, you could want! The two things most human beings would choose above-all the trouble is, humans do have a knack of choosing precisely those things which are worst for them

* Fear of a name increases fear of the thing itself.

* The truth- it is a beautiful and terrible thing, and should, therefore, be treated with great caution.

* You see, only one who wanted to find the stone- find it, but not use it- would be able to get it.

* It takes a great deal of bravery to stand up to our enemies, but just as much to stand up to our friends.

* When in doubt, go to the library

* It is our choices, Harry, that show what we truly are, far more than our abilities.

* Never trust anything that can think for itself, if you cannot see where it keeps its brain.

* The consequences of our actions are always so complicated, so diverse, that predicting the future is a very difficult business indeed.

* You think the dead we have loved truly leave us? You think that we don’t recall them more clearly than ever in times of great trouble

* Time will not slow down when something unpleasant lies ahead

* The sooner you know what you are up against, the better. How are you supposed to defend yourself against something you’ve never seen? A wizard who’s about to put an illegal curse on you isn’t going to tell you what he’s about to do. He’s not going to do it nice and polite to your face. You need to be prepared. You need to be alert and watchful.

* I am what I am, and I’m not ashamed. Never be ashamed, there are some who’ll hold it against you, but they’re not worth bothering’ with.

* If you want to know what a man’s like, take a good look at how he treats his inferiors, not his equals.

* Understanding is the first step to acceptance, and only with acceptance can there be recovery

* You fail to recognise that it matters not what someone is born, but what they grow up to be.

* Differences of habit and language are nothing at all if our aims are identical and our hearts are open.

* The mind is not a book, to be opened at will and examined at leisure. Thoughts are not etched on the inside of skulls, to be pursued by any invader. The mind is a complex and many-layered thing, or at least, most minds are.

* Youth cannot know how age thinks and feels. But old men are guilty if they forget what it was to be young.

* Some wounds run too deep for the healing.

* To fight, and fight again, and keep fighting, for only then could evil be kept at bay, though never quite eradicated.

* A full stomach meant good spirits, an empty one, bickering and gloom.

* The life he had lost had hardly ever seemed so real to him as at this moment when he knew he was about to see the place where it had been taken from him.

* Where your treasure is, there will your heart be also.

* The last enemy that shall be destroyed is death

* Wit beyond measure is man’s greatest treasure

* Which is that the possessor of the wand must capture it from its previous owner if he is to be truly the master of it.

* After all this time?..always

* His will to live had always been so much stronger than his fear of death

* It is a curious thing Harry, but Perhaps those who are best suited for power are those who have never sought it. Those who, like you have leadership thrust upon them, and take up the mantle because they must, and find to their own surprise that they wear it well.

* You are the true master of death because the true master does not seek to run away from death. He accepts that he must die, and understands that there are far, far worse things in the living world than dying

* Do not pity the dead Harry. Pity the living, and above all, those who live without love.

* Of course, it is happening inside your head, Harry, but why on earth should that mean that it is not real?
