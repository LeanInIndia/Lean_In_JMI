# Lean_In
A collection of material from the book [Lean In by Sheryl Sandberg](http://leanin.org/book/), and also from the rest of the web.

> "I have written this book to encourage women to dream big, forge a path through the obstacles, and
achieve their full potential. I am hoping that each woman will set her own goals and reach for them
with gusto. And I am hoping that each man will do his part to support women in the workplace and in
the home, also with gusto. As we start using the talents of the entire population, our institutions will be
more productive, our homes will be happier, and the children growing up in those homes will no
longer be held back by narrow stereotypes. " -Sheryl Sandberg
