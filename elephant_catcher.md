## Introduction
* In some ways, starting something is easier than scaling it. That is why people and their businesses hit the proverbial glass ceiling despite a successful start.
* Reputation is a form of capital and growing it right, beyond just good public relations, is something that organizations often overlook.

## Part I: The idea of scale

### Chapter 1:
* **Those who do not embrace the notion of size and cannot enjoy magnitude will always have problem with it.**
* And it is common knowledge that a self-regulating system minimizes the need for bureaucracy.

### Chapter 2
* **If you are not ambitious enough to scale, and scale big, you will not need to engage with the term strategy.**
* The absence of strategy while scaling may lead to an organizational downfall even if is sense of purpose is strong.
Strategy and scale go hand in hand. You don't need to think of strategy if incremental growth makes you happy. On the other hand, if you are seized with ambition of making a big difference you need a strategy. And you need to understand its true import.
* Great strategy is simplicity that even doorman can understand.
* When you are out to achieve exceptional success you will have to approach every aspect with a deeper view. The success of a strategy depends on the ability of those who conceive it to see the bigger picture and the interconnected nature of things.
* Attack a problem with sales by emphasizing on the training and development of the salespeople, fix the attrition issue by improving your badge value; and expand your business not by making your customer list looks like Noah's ark, but by being selective about your customer in knowing which ones when served perfectly, can deliver exponential growth you are looking for.
* As organizations sprout, some elements of strategic thinking are certainly at play but these are always nested at the top. As the same organizations experience rapid growth, strategic capacity must become fractal; people at all levels must be encouraged to think strategically. Companies do not scale themselves; it is the people who take it to the next step.
* **Polman's thinking exemplifies another, often unseen, characteristic of great strategy; it not the child of reason; it is an act of emotion.**
* Strategy is as strategy does, and when it comes to strategy simple is smart.

### Chapter 3
* Organizations that are designed for growth have to think of infrastructure at three distinct but interconnected levels. Frist, the physical infrastructure, these are your offices, factories, warehouses, and retail outlets. Then the intellectual infrastructure. this consists of the enabling systems, process and methodologies. Above these lies the emotional infrastructure. this involved, among other things, the accessibility of an organization's leaders and how its communities work within the system, its ability to respond to crises, and the propagation of its core vision and values.
* Early investment in an appropriate information system that mimics a living being's nervous system has boundless advantages.
* **If your vision is to cross an ocean, you won't build a bamboo bridge.**

### Chapter 4
* There is the little similarity in purpose and process, from planning to execution, between hunting small game like rabbit and catching elephants.
* **You catch a rabbit to eat its meat. It has consumptive value but no regenerative value. You don't catch the elephant to eat it; once caught and tamed, it is meant to be an economic resource. While the rewards are great, the risks are very personal, and failed enterprise can bring the previous injury and may even prove fatal.**
* Being able to work future backward by imagining what customers, supplier and employee of the future, five and even ten years out, will expect from the organization is the perfect starting point.
