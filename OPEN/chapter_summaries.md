## Chapter 2:
* Title: Igniting Passion
* Video:[Chp-2](https://youtu.be/Op_RcGhzvcM)
* Jim's Leadership Tips:
    - **Passion is contagious.** Begin to personally display emotion, and others will follow.
    - **Most companies have a stated purpose or mission.** If yours doesn't, advocate to develop one. It it does, make sure you integrate it into your dialogue with others. It needs to be part of everyday discourse.
    - **Add passionate words to your vocabulary at work, like "love", "hate", "excited", or "urgent."** It should be easy-you already use them at home. Others will start to use them if you do.
    - **Add questions to tease out passion when you interview.** Ask "what are you passionate about?" or "what inspires you?"
    - **Create vehicles for people to show their unvarnished selves** Company outings or team-building events need to allow for some silliness.


## Chapter 3:
* Title: Building Engagement
* Video: [Chp-3](https://youtu.be/hIFI3ZuRs3U)
* Jim's Leadership Tips:
    - **Enter every interaction with people on your organization believing that each person is equally accountable for his or her contributiond and performance to everyone else, regardless of reporting relationship.**
    - **If your boss is not providing the appropriate context, ask for it.** Most bossed are happy to share. They just haven't yet figured out that it's part of what they should be doing.
    - **Understand the tools and vehicles your company has for internal communications.** Use them or advocate to get better ones.
    
    **FOR PEOPLE MANAGERS**
        - **Use every interactioon as an opportunity to share context and knowledge.** 
        - **Equip your team with the skills and knowledge to be successful.**

    **FOR INDIVIDUAL CONTRIBUTORS**
        - **Don't wait for your manager to provode context.** Be proactive. Understand your company's strategy, and do what you can do to make it successful.
        - **Engage with your peers.** Learn from them and let them learn from you.    
## Chapter 4:
* Title: Choosing Meritocracy, Not Democracy
* Video: [Chp-4](https://youtu.be/L15D2WEmsAo)
* Jim's Leadership Tips:
    - **Don't use phrases like "the boss wants it this way" or rely on hierarchical name dropping.** While that may get things done in the short term, it can curtail discussion that's core to building a meritocracy.
    - **Publicly recognize a great effort or contribution.** It can be a simple thank-you e-mail in which you copy the whole team.
    - **Consider whether your influence comes from your position in the hierarchy(or access to privileged information), or whether it truly comes from the respect that you have earned.** If it is the former, start working on the latter.
    - **Proactively ask for feedback and ideas on a specific topic.** You must respond to them all, but implement only the good ones. And don't just take best ideas and move on; take every opportunity to reinforce the spirit of mertocracy by giving credit where it's due.
    - **Reward a high performing member of your team with an interesting assignment, even if it is not in his or her usual area.**


## Chapter 5:
* Title: Letting the Sparks Fly
* Video: [Chp-5](https://youtu.be/KeJpmGoXAk4)
* Jim's Leadership Tips:
    - **Proactively invite feedback and then thank those who give it to you.** Feedback is a gift. As a leader or manager, if you react defensively, you are unlikey to get that gift again.
    - **Start a debate.** If your organization isn't used to open, frank debate, start with easy topics. Make sure no one takes it personally.
    - **If forums don't exist for healthy debate, create them.** If you're a popple manager, debating with your team is easy. If you're an individual contributor, find ways to initiate dialogue with others in the company.
    - **Recognize the myraid barriers to frank dialogue.** For example, never start a contentious conversation on opposite sides of desk, and recognize that offices are home turf. Pick neutral places.
    - **Does your organization avoid the "elephant in the room" conversations?** If so, think about what role you can play to initiate those discussions.

## Chapter 6:
* Title: Making Inclusive Decisions
* Video: [Chp-6](https://youtu.be/khb2olG4Ppc)
* Jim's Leadership Tips:
    - **When you make your next decision, reflect on whether it was influenced by other's point of view.** If so, did their influence change your decision? If not, how might the decision have been different if you had considered other's perspectives?
    - **Ask one or two thought leaders on your team their opinions on something you're considering.** They won't question your competence or decisiveness. They'll feel flattered.
    - **Before making your next decision, ask yourself whether others will be suprised.** If so, think about including them before finalizing it.
    - **Pick an issue and try openly discussing it with a broader group, whether in a staff meeting or an informal gathering.** After a while, it will become natural.
    - **Try to observe the difference in execution of decisions that were made openly, with input, versus those that truly came from the top down.**

## Chapter 7:
* Title: Catalyzing Direction
* Video: [Chp-7](https://youtu.be/QUo6tl0YWUw)
* Jim's Leadership Tips:
    - **Find or create a venue in which to discuss areas where you would like to see your team make progress**
    - **Tell your team members about a problem you are trying to solve** See how they respond, and if they are able to help solve it.
    - **In an area where you would like to see progress, ask questions of your team rather than request action.** Most likely, action will occur.
    - **Create some space for your team to innovate by purposely leaving some ambiguity in your direction on a specific process or task.**
    - **Ask your team to come to you with ideas and proposals.** Engage and discuss them, regardless of whether you move forward with them.
