* Jim's Leadership Tips:
    - **Passion is contagious.** Begin to personally display emotion, and others will follow.
    - **Most companies have a stated purpose or mission.** If yours doesn't, advocate to develop one. It it does, make sure you integrate it into your dialogue with others. It needs to be part of everyday discourse.
    - **Add passionate words to your vocabulary at work, like "love", "hate", "excited", or "urgent."** It should be easy-you already use them at home. Others will start to use them if you do.
    - **Add questions to tease out passion when you interview.** Ask "what are you passionate about?" or "what inspires you?"
    - **Create vehicles for people to show their unvarnished selves** Company outings or team-building events need to allow for some silliness.
