We stand on the shoulders of the women who came before us, women who had to fight for the rights that we now take for granted.

But knowing that things could be worse should not stop us from trying to make them better.


Girls growing up today are not the first generation to have
equal opportunity, but they are the first to know that all that opportunity does not necessarily translate
into professional achievement. Many of these girls watched their mothers try to “do it all” and then
decide that something had to give. That something was usually their careers.

“She is very ambitious” is not a compliment in our culture. Aggressive and hard-charging
women violate unwritten rules about acceptable social conduct.

Leadership roles are not the only way to have profound impact.

Fear is at the root of so many of the barriers that women face. Fear of not being liked. Fear of
making the wrong choice. Fear of drawing negative attention. Fear of overreaching. Fear of being
judged. Fear of failure. And the holy trinity of fear: the fear of being a bad mother/wife/daughter.

So please ask yourself: What would I do if I weren’t afraid? And then go do it.

Many people, but especially women, feel fraudulent when they are praised for their accomplishments. Instead of feeling worthy of recognition, they feel undeserving and guilty, as if a mistake has been made. Despite being high achievers, even experts in their fields,
women can’t seem to shake the sense that it is only a matter of time until they are found out for who they really are—impostors with limited skills or abilities.

It’s a cliché, but opportunities are rarely offered; they’re seized.

there is no perfect fit when you’re looking for the next big thing to do. 

The ability to learn is the most important quality a leader can have.

We are so rarely brave enough to tell the truth.

And believe me, the truth hurts. But the upside of painful knowledge is so much
greater than the downside of blissful ignorance.

Sharing emotions builds deeper relationships. 

Motivation comes from working on things we care
about. It also comes from working with people we care about. 

I no longer think people have a professional self for Mondays through Fridays and a real self for the rest of
the time. Instead of putting on some kind of fake “all-work persona,” I think we benefit from expressing
our truth, talking about personal situations, and acknowledging that professional decisions are often
emotionally driven.

The classic scenario unfolds like this. An ambitious and successful woman heads down a
challenging career path with the thought of having children in the back of her mind. At some point,
this thought moves to the front of her mind, typically once she finds a partner.

SHe refers to herself as “a career-loving parent,” a nice alternative to “working mom.”

Parenting may be the most rewarding experience, but it is also the hardest and most humbling. If there were a right way
to raise kids, everyone would do it. Clearly, that is not the case.

Anyone lucky enough to have options should keep them open. Don’t enter the workforce already
looking for the exit. D

“It’s not about biology, but about consciousness.”

I truly believe that the single most important career decision that a woman makes is whether she
will have a life partner and who that partner is. I don’t know of one woman in a leadership position
whose life partner is not fully—and I mean fully—supportive of her career. No exceptions.

It takes continual communication, honesty, and a lot of forgiveness to maintain a rickety
balance.

Making gender matters even worse, men’s success is viewed not just in absolute terms, but often in
comparison to their wives’. The image of a happy couple still includes a husband who is more
professionally successful than the wife. If the reverse occurs, it’s perceived as threatening to the
marriage.

When looking for a life partner, my advice to women is date all of them: the bad boys, the cool
boys, the commitment-phobic boys, the crazy boys. But do not marry them. 

When it comes time to settle down, find someone
who wants an equal partner. Someone who thinks women should be smart, opinionated, and
ambitious. Someone who values fairness and expects or, even better, wants to do his share in the
home. These men exist and, trust me, over time, nothing is sexier.

As Sharon Poczter, professor of economics at Cornell, explains, “The antiquated
rhetoric of ‘having it all’ disregards the basis of every economic relationship: the idea of trade-offs.
All of us are dealing with the constrained optimization that is life, attempting to maximize our utility
based on parameters like career, kids, relationships, etc., doing our best to allocate the resource of
time. Due to the scarcity of this resource, therefore, none of us can ‘have it all,’ and those who claim
to are most likely lying.”

Pursuing both a professional and personal life is a noble and
attainable goal, up to a point. Women should learn from Icarus to aim for the sky, but keep in mind
that we all have real limits.

No, the worst question is ‘How do you juggle it
all?’ ... People constantly ask me, with an accusatory look in their eyes. ‘You’re fucking it all up,
aren’t you?’ their eyes say.”

Done is better than perfect.”

Aiming for perfection
causes frustration at best and paralysis at worst. 

Ephron insisted, “It will be a little messy, but embrace the mess. It will be
complicated, but rejoice in the complications. It will not be anything like what you think it will be
like, but surprises are good for you. And don’t be frightened: you can always change your mind. I
know: I’ve had four careers and three husbands.”

We overwork to overcompensate.

It is difficult to distinguish between the aspects of a job that are truly necessary and those that are
not. Sometimes the situation is hard to read and the lines are hard to draw.

Sleeping four or five hours a night induces mental impairment equivalent to a blood alcohol level above the
legal driving limit. Sleep deprivation makes people anxious, irritable, and confused.
If I could go back and change one thing about how I lived in those early years, I would force myself to
get more sleep.

Guilt management can be just as important as time management for mothers.

If I had to embrace a definition of success, it would be that success is making the best choices we
can ... and accepting them.

The secret is there is no secret—just doing the best you can with what you’ve got.

I said out loud that there are differences between
men and women both in their behavior and in the way their behavior is perceived by others.

The simple act of talking
openly about behavioral patterns makes the subconscious conscious.

Talking can transform minds, which can transform behaviors, which can transform institutions.

Shutting down discussion is self-defeating and impedes progress. We need to talk and listen and
debate and refute and instruct and learn and evolve.

Every job will demand some sacrifice. 


We cannot change what we are unaware of, and once we are aware, we cannot help but change.

Leadership is about making others better as a
result of your presence and making sure that impact lasts in your absence.

It is time to cheer on girls and women who want to sit at the
table, seek challenges, and lean in to their careers.

Equal opportunity is not equal unless everyone receives
the encouragement that makes seizing those opportunities possible. Only then can both men and women achieve their full potential.

As former secretary of state
Madeleine Albright once said, “There’s a special place in hell for women who don’t help other
women.”

women are not just victims of
sexism, they can also be perpetrators.

Gender should neither magnify nor excuse rude and dismissive treatment. We should expect
professional behavior, and even kindness, from everyone.



True equality will be achieved only when we all fight the stereotypes that hold us back. 

It’s up to us to end the self-fulfilling belief that “women can’t do this, women can’t do that.”
Throwing up our hands and saying “It can’t be done” ensures that it will never be done.




The hard work of generations before us means that equality is within our reach. We can close the
leadership gap now. Each individual’s success can make success a little easier for the next. We can do
this—for ourselves, for one another, for our daughters, and for our sons. If we push hard now, this
next wave can be the last wave. In the future, there will be no female leaders. There will just be
leaders.
